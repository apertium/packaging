Comment: The official stance of the Apertium project is that when one of our
 repositories don't clarify the license beyond putting the GPL COPYING file in
 the repo, then it should be interpreted as the "or any later" version of it to
 maximize reusability.
 .
 The data is often mixed with GPLv3 data at compile time, often by the same
 authors, but where the GPLv2 stuff just predates wider GPLv3 adoption.
