Package: libfst-tools

Architecture: any
Provides: openfst
Depends: libfst22 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: weighted finite-state transducers library (tools)
 OpenFst is a library for constructing, combining, optimizing, and searching
 weighted finite-state transducers (FSTs). Weighted finite-state transducers
 are automata where each transition has an input label, an output label, and a
 weight. The more familiar finite-state acceptor is represented as a transducer
 with each transition's input and output label equal. Finite-state acceptors
 are used to represent sets of strings (specifically, regular or rational
 sets); finite-state transducers are used to represent binary relations between
 pairs of strings (specifically, rational transductions). The weights can be
 used to represent the cost of taking a particular transition.
 .
 This package provides the command line tools.

Description: weighted finite-state transducers library (base plugins)
 OpenFst is a library for constructing, combining, optimizing, and searching
 weighted finite-state transducers (FSTs).
 .
 This package contains base extensions that will be dynamically loaded
 into any binary compiled with OpenFst if the LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or
 equivalent) includes /usr/lib/fst.

Description: weighted finite-state transducers library (development)
